To fix the "Module not found" error, follow these steps:

1. **Verify the module name:** Double-check for any typos in the import statement. Case sensitivity matters in JavaScript.
2. **Install missing modules:** If the module is a third-party library, make sure it's installed using `expo install <package-name>`. Then rebuild your project with `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start`.
3. **Check file paths:** Ensure the import path is correct relative to the current file. If you're unsure, use absolute paths (starting from the project's root directory).
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes, the Expo cache can cause issues. Try running `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start`.  This forces a clean build of your project.
5. **Peer dependencies:** If you're working with a module that has peer dependencies, make sure those are also installed. They're specified in the package.json of the module in the `peerDependencies` section.

**Example of a corrected import:**

```javascript
// Correct import (assuming 'react' is installed)
import React from 'react';
```

```javascript
//Corrected import with a correctly defined component
import {MyComponent} from './MyComponent';
```

Remember to always check the module's documentation for correct usage and installation instructions.
